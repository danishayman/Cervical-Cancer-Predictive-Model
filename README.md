# üî¨ Cervical Cancer Predictive Model


## üìã Project Overview

This project develops machine learning models to predict cervical cancer based on various risk factors. Our goal is to create accurate and reliable predictive models that can help in early diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.

## üß† Key Features

- **Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: Comprehensive preprocessing including handling missing values, feature selection, and data normalization
- **Multiple Model Development**: Implementation of several machine learning algorithms including:
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks
  - Evolutionary Neural Networks
- **Model Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning to maximize performance metrics
- **Comparative Analysis**: Rigorous evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about risk factors for cervical cancer, including:

- Demographic information (age)
- Habits (smoking, contraceptive use)
- Sexual history
- Medical history
- STD-related information

The target variables for prediction are:
- Hinselmann
- Schiller
- Citology
- Biopsy

## üîç Key Findings

### Part 1: Traditional ML Approach
- SVM outperformed Decision Trees with an accuracy of **74.63%** vs. **64.18%**
- SVM showed better recall values across all classes, indicating fewer false negatives
- SVM demonstrated improved performance in precision, recall, and F1-score metrics

### Part 2: Neural Network Approach
- The Evolutionary Neural Network model achieved a test accuracy of **75.25%**
- Precision: **76.30%**
- Recall: **79.52%**
- F1 Score: **77.88%**
- The hybrid model showed significant improvement over the traditional feedforward neural network
